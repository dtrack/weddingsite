                  <h2>Getting to Tours</h2>
                  <p>
                    Our recommendation is to fly into Paris and take the train
                    to Tours. Paris main airports are <strong>"Paris Charles de Gaulle"
                    (CDG)</strong> and <strong>"Paris Orly" (ORY)</strong>.
                    CDG is more convenient because it has a TGV station (fast train)
                    in the airport with direct trains to Tours. If you land in Orly
                    you will have to take public transportation
                    or a cab to the Paris Montparnasse train station in downtown Paris.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Moving around</h2>
                  <p>
                    Train is a great option and it can take you anywhere in France.
                    However, it can get pricy if you plan to visit a lot of places.
                    Renting a car is probably a better option in this case.
                    <strong>
                      Please note that our standard rentals are stick shift
                    </strong>, so be sure to request an automatic if you need.
                    If you decide to rent a car it is about a 3 hour drive from
                    Paris to Tours (as opposed to a little over an hour by train).
                    Lastly, another option is to take the train to Tours and rent
                    a car there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carpool may also be an option from Paris. There are carpooling
                    websites, but we can also try to coordinate
                    with Jeremy's parisian friends driving down for the wedding
                    (this is very common in France, and it's a great chance to meet
                    some cool locals!).
                    <br>
                    On the day of the wedding, there should also be plenty of carpool
                    options for our international guests.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lodging</h2>
                  <p>
                    <strong>On the night of the wedding, a room will be provided
                    on the domaine for all our international guests!</strong>
                    Please let us know in the RSVP how many beds are needed for
                    your party.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the other days, it is mostly similar to the US,
                    you can find hotels and motels along with
                    AirBnb's everywhere. We also have a more typical option in France
                    called "Gîte", comparable to a Bed & Breakfast.
                    Finally, as an option, we can see if any of Jeremy's friends and
                    family are willing to host. Please don't hesitate to ask
                    they will be delighted!

                  <p>
                    If you fly to CDG, put in <strong>CDG</strong> as your
                    departure. If you fly
                    to ORY, put in <strong>"Paris (PAR)"</strong>
                     as your departure. <br>
                    Put <strong>"Tours"</strong> as
                    your destination.<br>
                    For the results from Paris (not CDG) you will find 2 options
                    to depart from: <strong>"Paris Austerlitz"</strong> and
                    <strong>"Paris Montparnasse"</strong>.
                    Montparnasse only has TGVs that will take you to Tours in
                    one hour. Austerlitz has slower (2-3 hours) but cheaper (11 to 40 euros)
                    trains. In both cases, you will have to travel from the Orly
                    airport to the station in downtown Paris (about an hour of public transit).
